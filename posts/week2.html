                Week 2 - Preparing the visuals
            </h1>
            <p>
                This week, I focused on giving the site some aesthetic, and using CSS to give the site some character. To develop some kind of direction, <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/visual-design.html">'visual design basics'</a> were referred to. These rules can differ slightly between personal preference and purpose.

                I first dealt with color, and the immediate impression the site gives upon loading to the screen. Before, this blog was very bland with a simple layout and solid, uninteresting backgroound. After tweaking the styling and adding some components, the site now has a much more unique look. A background was added that doesn't draw too much attention away from the content, and the colors are set to define clear regions and display information properly. A slightly interactive menu bar was also added, which fills the space and makes the page seems much less empty.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many other aspects, such as line drawing, typography, and the use and inclusion of other visual artifacts. Attention to lines and boundaries were given as well, as the menu bar and main content looks much nicer when snapped together in a good fit. The popular font "Roboto" was chosen for the site. All of these details are, of course, subject to change and evolve as style is added and improved.

                Exploring the Concept
            </h1>
            <p>
                Aside from an opportunity for self expression, designing a visually pleasing website is important for clarity as well. According to many of the sites that list these important visual aspects, aesthetic design can promote better retention of information, better engagement with the content, and can also sway users to beleive the site or system is easier or pleasant to use.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><a href="https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/visual-design">This site</a> gives a list of design principles as well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Unity</li>
                <li>Gestalt</li>
                <li>Hierarchy</li>
                <li>Balance</li>
                <li>Contrast</li>
                <li>Scale</li>
                <li>Dominance</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                In a perfect world, every site would act as a perfect template for what it is aiming to do. While these design principles are similar across sources, minor differences and the nature of the web itself make it seem as though these concepts belong to an art, not a science. The question, then, is how these principles can aid in making my blog more engaging and easier to read. Trying to add to much may make the website busy, and distract from the content, however the site should be interesting to look at and navigate as well in order to maintain focus on the page. Throughout the semester, these principles will be explored to see which methods and additions improve the blog.
