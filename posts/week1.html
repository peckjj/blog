                The course begins with exploring the fundamentals of the Internet, the Web, HTTP, and the structure and common elements of HTML. <span class="code-text">HTML</span> is simply a markup language for instructing a browser how to display content to the screen. Elements to be displayed can be nested into child-parent hierarchies and their attributes can be set - inline, or through <span class="code-text">CSS</span> - to achieve a desired layout and appearance.

                There are several elements in HTML which allow websites to display information in proper formats. Some of the most common can be found below. In today's lab, small example websites were created using elements such as headers, lists, and links.
