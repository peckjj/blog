                <h1>Week 5 - Experimenting with Color</h1>

                <p>
                    Among many design decisions that need to be made for properly displaying information on a webpage, color scheme must be carefully chosen to give appropriate contrast to artifacts on the screen. The selected color scheme should serve one or more of a variety of purposes:

                    <ul>
                        <h4>The color scheme should...</h4>
                        <li>Provide aesthetic to improve engagement.</li>
                        <li>Increase boundary separations to increase clarity.</li>
                        <li>Be appropriate for the content of the page.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <h4>While the color scheme should NOT...</h4>
                        <li>Contain dissonant colors that "clash".</li>
                        <li>Be to bright or erratic to distract from the content.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In short, a desirable color scheme is appealing to the eye and encourages interaction with the site and the content.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In many cases, the organization or subject of a website may be assoicated with a particular set of colors, but even if a main theme is selected, there may stil be a need for more colors. Color can be an effective means of communicating information. They can indicate when things are <span id="good">good</span> or <span id="bad">bad</span>, they can <span id="separate">separate</span> <span id="boundaries">boundaries</span>, and <span id="r">can</span> <span id="o">generally</span> <span id="y">bring</span> <span id="g">life</span> <span id="b">to</span> <span id="i">your</span> <span id="v">webpage.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Much like the previous sentence, however, color can also distract from the content itself when used inappropriately. Fortunately, color has been well studied, and there are principles that can be followed to achieve a harmonious set of colors. Consider the following principles from <a href="https://uxplanet.org/color-theory-brief-guide-for-designers-76e11c57eaa">uxplanet.org</a>. This article was recommended by <a href="interaction-design.org">interaction-design.org</a>.

                <p>Below is the color wheel.</p>
                <img alt="Color Wheel" src="../static/colorwheel.png"/>
                <p>Various color schemes can be created based of the relative location of individual colors on the wheel.</p>
                
                <h3>Monochromatic</h3>
                <p>A monochromatic scheme can be used to mitigate complexity with color. It can be used similar to gray scale, where separation is by shade rather than hue.</p>
                <div class="swatch">
                    <div id="mono-1"></div>
                    <div id="mono-2"></div>
                    <div id="mono-3"></div>
                </div>

                <h3>Analogous</h3>
                <p>Analogous colors tend to blend together rather than stand apart. Schemes like this can be useful for when little contrast on a page is needed or desired.</p>
                <div class="swatch">
                    <div id="analog-1"></div>
                    <div id="analog-2"></div>
                    <div id="analog-3"></div>
                </div>

                <h3>Complementary</h3>
                <p>Complementary colors are found as far apart as possible on the color wheel. Imagine an equilateral triangle in the center of the color wheel, and the three vertices mark a complementary set of three colors. These colors produce high contrast, and can make a page seem very bright or eccentric.</p>
                <div class="swatch">
                    <div id="comp-1"></div>
                    <div id="comp-2"></div>
                    <div id="comp-3"></div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The additional schemes in the article combine or slightly modify the fundamental models above. These schemes can be applied to as many colors as needed, although more colors will increase the chances of conflict between them. There are other factors that should drive color selection as well, however. The designer should always consider the potential implications of color to the target audience, and should avoid colors that may not be accessible. Red-Green color-blindness is common, and sites should avoid using these colors frequently or close together.
